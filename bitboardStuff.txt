^ for all but intersection

Adding two bitboards for "all white pieces" and "all black pieces" might accelerate further computations.
 You might also want to hold a database of bitboards representing the squares attacked by a certain piece on a certain square, 
etc.; these constants come in handy at move generation time. 
The main justification for bit boards is that a lot of useful operations can be performed using the processor's 
instruction set's 1-cycle logical operators.
